On 64 bit windows the default calling convention doesn't pass SIMD arguments in register. Istead it copies them into memory and passes the addresses in integer register. Not sure why it was designed this way. One use for doing it this way might be that you can call these function on system that don't support SSE then inside the function based on the support different code is executed. To make this faster the vectorcall calling convention was introduced.
